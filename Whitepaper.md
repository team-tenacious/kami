# kami project

digital household deities on the blockchain, manifesting themselves via augmented reality.

## introduction

Kami (Japanese: 神, [kaꜜmi]) are the spirits or phenomena that are worshipped in the religion of Shinto. They can be elements of the landscape, forces of nature, as well as beings and the qualities that these beings express; they can also be the spirits of venerated dead persons. Many kami are considered the ancient ancestors of entire clans (some ancestors became kami upon their death if they were able to embody the values and virtues of kami in life). Traditionally, great or sensational leaders like the Emperor could be or became kami.

Digital Kami are made by 3d artists or makers, who publish the code to a central marketplace where they can be bought by devotees, the makers of Kami sign their works digitally with a "makers mark" or crest, that is a human-friendly symbol that encodes a public key to ensure originality. Kami become in effect 3d augmented sculptures that are owned by devotees. Each devotee possesses a crest as well, the same mechanism of the makers mark, which is attached to a digital altar which placed on any surface becomes a location where spirits owned by the devotee manifest themselves via augmented reality.

## celestial plane

The API and central hub where off-chain Kami data is stored, and the UI for the Kami trading hub is called the celestial plane.

## altar

The Altar is a GPS locked symbol that the site for a household or owners Kami manifest themselves at via augmented reality. Kami can be viewed via a mobile app or a VR instrument such as the Occulus Rift.

## pearls of wisdom

Kami can be taught wisdom by their owners, a small wise phrase or pearl is encoded and stored on the blockchain, pearls are deciminated to other Kami which show the wisdom as text beneath their makers mark, via a random scattering. Devotees show their gratitude or aversion for pearls by upvoting or downvoting pearls - this voting comes at a small cost, but if there is a +50% agreement on wisdom acorss the network, those who voted with the majority are recompensed and rewarded for their advice.

The originator of the wisdom's Kami becomes wiser every time a pearl originating from the Kami's address achieves a higher ranking in a decentralised ledger of scored pearls. A wise Kami is valuable and can be traded for more.

## secrets

Kami can also be told secrets by their makers and owners, secrets can be pearls or links to hidden digital treasure, encrypted with the owners public key, when Kami are transferred from one owner to another the secrets are decrypted and re-encrypted with the new owners public key. Suprise secrets are also randomly encoded into unsold deities, containing bonus pearls or encypted wallets with digital currency in them.

## transfer of ownership

A Kami can be transferred from one owner to another, either as a sale or as a gift, families could pass digital Kami down as forms of inheritance, or for specific events (study well, get well etc.) Kami's can be specified by their owner or maker whether they are unipresent, so can only be owned by one person and will only appear at one altar, or omnipresent where they can have multiple owners. Unipresent Kami made by popular makers would have a higher market value than omnipresent Kami. The greater Kami (generalised ones from Shinto) will be created by well-known artists and will be made omnipresent, although they will be cheaper to purchase, the maker will get a small commission for each purchse of his/her creation.
