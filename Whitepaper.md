# kami project

digital household deities on the blockchain, manifesting themselves via augmented reality.

## introduction

Kami (Japanese: 神, [kaꜜmi]) are the spirits or phenomena that are worshipped in the religion of Shinto. They can be elements of the landscape, forces of nature, as well as beings and the qualities that these beings express; they can also be the spirits of venerated dead persons. Many kami are considered the ancient ancestors of entire clans (some ancestors became kami upon their death if they were able to embody the values and virtues of kami in life). Traditionally, great or sensational leaders like the Emperor could be or became kami.

Digital Kami are made by 3d artists or creators, who publish the code to a central marketplace where they can be bought by seekers (owners/devotees/seekers of wisdom), the creators of Kami sign their works digitally with a "creators mark" or crest, that is a human-friendly symbol that encodes a public key to ensure originality. Kami become in effect 3d augmented sculptures that are owned by seekers. Each devotee possesses a crest as well, the same mechanism of the creators mark, which is attached to a digital altar which placed on any horizontal surface becomes a location where spirits owned by the devotee manifest themselves via augmented reality.

The first Kami to exist on the market will be the demo-gods, to show that the technology works.

## seakers, creators and crests

The crest is a symbol for a creator or seeker, containing a digital stenographic watermark ensuring it is both identifiable by man or machine. It must be possible to extract an ethereum address from the symbol. Creators are digital artists who create and sell Kami, seekers are those who by and enshrine their Kami. 

## celestial plane

The API and central hub where off-chain Kami data is stored, and the UI for the Kami trading hub is called the celestial plane.

## the veil

Augmented reality app for viewing Kami manifestations. (mobile app / AR HUD / VR HUD) 

## the shrine

The shrine is a GPS locked symbolic site where a household or owners' Kami are manifested via the augmented reality veil. Kami can be viewed via a mobile app or a VR instrument such as the Occulus Rift. The shrine must be placed within a predefined GPS coordinate range (modify-able by the owner or devotee via the celestial plane), for spirits to successfully manifest via the veil.

## pearls of wisdom

Kami can be taught wisdom by their owners, a small wise phrase or pearl is encoded and stored on the blockchain, pearls are deciminated to other Kami which show the wisdom as text beneath their creators mark, via a random scattering. Devotees show their gratitude or aversion for pearls by upvoting or downvoting pearls - this voting comes at a small cost, but if there is a +50% agreement on wisdom acorss the network, those who voted with the majority are recompensed and rewarded for their advice.

The originator of the wisdom's Kami becomes wiser every time a pearl originating from the Kami's address achieves a higher ranking in a decentralised ledger of scored pearls. A wise Kami is valuable and can be traded for more.

## mysteries

Kami can also be told secrets by their creators and owners, mysteries can be pearls or links to hidden digital treasure, encrypted with the owners public key, when Kami are transferred from one owner to another the mysteries are decrypted and re-encrypted with the new owners public key. Suprise mysteries are also randomly encoded into unsold deities by angelic algorithms in the celestial plane , containing bonus pearls or encypted wallets...

## transfer of ownership

A Kami can be transferred from one owner to another, either as a sale or as a gift, families could pass digital Kami down as forms of inheritance, or for specific events (study well, get well etc.) Kami's can be specified by their owner or creators whether they are unipresent, so can only be owned by one person and will only appear at one altar, or omnipresent where they can have multiple owners. Unipresent Kami made by popular creators would have a higher market value than omnipresent Kami. The greater Kami (generalised ones from Shinto) will be created by well-known artists and will be made omnipresent, although they will be cheaper to purchase, the creators will get a small commission for each purchse of his/her creation.

## revenue model

Any push interaction with the celestial plane comes at a cost, as the planes integration layer is a series of Ethereum smart contracts. So a tiny bit of gas is charged to upload a pearl or mystery or to upvote or downvote a mystery. Publishing a Kami and buying and selling Kami's also comes at a charge. Creating a digital crest also costs, the crest and an ethereum public key needs to be registered with the celestial plane before it becomes possible to publish or purchase a Kami.

# adoption

There is a rich heritage in folklore for most cultures involving household deities or lesser god-like beings or spirits, of interest here are the eastern cultures: [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitchen_God), [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinto) and [Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasin_faith). Notably these cultures are also early adopters of crypto-currencies, this mix of culture and decentralization early adoption may make the ideal earthly plane for Kami to manifest themselves in.
